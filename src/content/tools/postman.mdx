# Introduction
[Railflow](https://railflow.io) provides a powerful and convenient NPM package which can be run from your favorite CI application and upload [Postman/Newman](https://www.postman.com/) reports into TestRail easily. Doing this brings all testing activity inside TestRail giving you a clear picture of overall testing progress with TestRail's powerful dashboards.
    
To integrate your Postman collection with TestRail, the following steps should be done:

1. Run your collection with Postman or Newman and save execution report in JSON file
2. Install Railflow NPM package
3. Run Railflow command line interface and feed report file to it


## Running your tests with Postman/Newman
To export test results into TestRail, a Newman JSON report is required. The report can be generated either from Postman itself or with Newman:

### Generating test report with Postman
If you run your test collection from Postman directly then report can be exported by clicking on `Export Results` button.

### Generating test report with Newman
To generate test report with Newman just execute your newman `run` command:

```shell
newman run mycollection.json --reporters cli,json --reporter-json-export outputfile.json
```

This will generate the `outputfile.json` report file which Railflow can parse.

## Railflow NPM package installation

Run the following command to install Railflow globally:

```shell
npm install -g railflow
```

## Uploading test results into TestRail

Once the JSON report file has been generated, it can be passed into Railflow for uploading results into Railflow:

```shell
railflow -k <license key> -url <TestRail URL> -u <username> -p <password> -pr <project name> -path <suite name>/<section name>/<subsection name> -f newman -r outputfile.json
```

Where:
*  `license key` - the Railflow license key
*  `TestRail URL` - The URL of TestRail server, e.g., https://testrail.yourcompany.com
*  `username` - the email id of the TestRail user, e.g., user@yourcompany.com
*  `password` - the password for TestRail user
*  `project name` - the name of a TestRail project into which results will be exported into
*  `path` - path to where Railflow should upload test case definitions, must start with Suite name (for single-suite project it is always `Master`), e.g. Master/Section/Subsection

E.g.:
```shell
railflow -k AAAAA-BBBBB-CCCCC-DDDDD -url https://testrail.yourcompany.com -u user@yourcompany.com -p someverysecurepassword -pr "Railflow Demo" -path "Master/Railflow/Postman Tests" -f newman -r outputfile.json
```

Please refer to the Railflow [`Command Line Arguments`](/cli/railflow-npm#command-line-arguments) reference for more details.
