# Introduction
[Railflow](https://railflow.io) can help you integrate your various testing tools and framework running via [TeamCity](https://jetbrains.com/teamcity/) with TestRail.  
Doing this brings all testing activity inside TestRail giving you a clear picture of overall testing progress with TestRail's powerful dashboards.  
Railflow provides two simple ways to integrate TeamCity with TestRail.

*  TeamCity native plugin
*  NPM module / CLI

This document will help guide you through each of them.

## TeamCity plugin
[TeamCity](https://jetbrains.com/teamcity/) plugin allows you to integrate your [TeamCity](https://jetbrains.com/teamcity/) with [TestRail](https://www.gurock.com/testrail/) in a few clicks!

## Plugin installation
*	Download current version of plugin from <https://railflow.io/download>
*	Click on `Administration` &#x2192 `Plugins List`

<ImageZoom src="cicd/teamcity/install-1.png" alt=""/><br/>

*	Click on `Upload plugin zip` &#x2192 `Browse` and select downloaded zip file and click on "Save" button

<ImageZoom src="cicd/teamcity/install-2.png" alt=""/><br/>

*	Restart TeamCity server

## Plugin configuration
Plugin configuration consists of two parts:

### Global settings configuration
Railflow global configurations are accessible on `Administration` &#x2192 `Railflow` page:

<ImageZoom src="cicd/teamcity/global-settings-1.png" alt=""/><br/>

|Section Name     | Field Name                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|Railflow License | Status                        | Status of the license		                                   |
|                 | Expiration Date               | Expiration date of the license	                               |
|                 | License Key                   | Option to activate license as a key	                           |
|                 | License File                  | Option to activate license as a file	                       |
|TestRail Servers | Name			              | Name of the TestRail server to uniquely identify server       |
|                 | Url				              | URL for your TestRail instance. Example: https://testrail:8080 |
|                 | Username				      | User Name of user in TestRail                                  |
|                 | Password				      | Password of TestRail user                                      |

The plugin requires a valid license key or license file. A free evaluation license key/file could be obtained from the [Railflow website](https://railflow.io/register).  
License key should be used when your TeamCity has Internet access, as the plugin will call for an external resource to validate the license.  
To apply license key, select the `License Key` option, put the license key into the text box and click the `Activate License` button.  

If your TeamCity does not have Internet access, please use a pre-activated license file.     
To apply license file, select the `License File` option and click on the `Choose File`, select the license file in .skm format and click on the `Upload License` button.

After the license is set, please add at least one TestRail server and fill all the configuration fields.

### "Railflow: Upload test results into TestRail" build step configuration

To upload test results into TestRail, a new `Railflow: Upload test results into TestRail` build step has to be added:

>**Note**
In order to upload results to TestRail in case when tests failed, just set `Execute step` field to `Even if some of the previous steps failed`. In such a case results will be uploaded regardless of the result of the previous step.

### Execution
Once the job is configured, simply run the build. Here is TeamCity build execution output example:

<ImageZoom src="cicd/teamcity/upload-results-log-1.png" alt=""/><br/>

<ImageZoom src="cicd/teamcity/upload-results-ci-1.png" alt=""/><br/>

And results in TestRail:

### Smart Failure Assignment

The Smart Failure Assignment feature allows to automatically assign failed test cases to a user from the list of users configured in `Assign To Users` build step configuration parameter. Users from the list are assigned in a round-robin manner.
Configured users should be valid users in TestRail and should have explicit access to TestRail project.

Due to the issue in the TestRail API, users should be configured explicitly on the project access page and have a role defined in the `Project Access` column:

#### Example
Consider a use case where five test cases are failing and two users are configured in `Assign To Users` field.

6. Click on the `Add Build Step` button again to Add the step for performing Railflow to upload the test results.
   1. Select `Command Line` for `Runner type`.
   2. Fill in an appropriate name for `Step name`, such as `Export test resuls`.
   3. Select `Even if some of the previous steps failed` for `Execute step`.
   4. Refer to [`Getting Started`](/) chapter to fill in the execution script for `Custom Script`.
   5. Click on the `Save` button to save the settings.
