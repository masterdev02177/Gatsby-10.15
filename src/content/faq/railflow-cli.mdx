## How to install Railflow license inside a docker container when there is no Internet connection?
In such a case you can use Railflow offline license file (with .skm extension) and either copy that file inside your docker container or upload it to some FTP/HTTP server and provide the URL with -l parameter, e.g.: `-l http://http-server-address/license-file.skm`

## How to view debug logs?
Railflow adds info/error messages into both, standard output and `logs/railflow.log` file in the current running directory. The log file also contains some additional information for debugging

## Error: "Project with name: 'XXX' does not exist. Please create it before exporting data"
1. Check if the project with the name 'XXX' exists in your TestRail server. The project name is case sensitive.
2. If your project name has spaces, make sure you have escaped the value with double quotes, e.g.: `-proj "Railflow Demo"`

## Error: "There are no report files"
Railflow cannot find any report file to upload. Please check the value of the `-r` (`--report-files`) parameter. It supports ant-style wildcards, e.g. `/surefire-reports/*.xml`.
